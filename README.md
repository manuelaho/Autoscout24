# Autoscout24
Autoscout24 data set on car sales and vehicle data from 2011 to 2021.

AutoScout24 is the largest online car market in Europe. With AutoScout24, users can buy
and sell used and new cars.

This project is about analyzing and visualizing the data set. The cleaned data is trained
using algorithms from the field of supervised learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, 
Random Forest Regression and PCA) in the form of a machine learning model so that precise price 
predictions can then be made.

The data set contains 9 features, has 46405 samples and, with the label “price”,
provides us with information about the price at which a car was sold.
